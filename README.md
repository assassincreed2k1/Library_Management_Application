## Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a Java-based application designed to assist with library management, including managing documents (books, magazines, newspapers), users (members, librarians), and borrowing/return transactions.  

## Features
- **Document Management:**
  - Add, edit, and delete documents (books, magazines, newspapers).
  - Search and view document details.
- **User Management:**
  - Register and log in to accounts.
  - Manage member and librarian information.
  - Renew membership cards.
- **Transactions:**
  - Borrow and return documents.
  - View transaction history.
- **Others:**
  - Review and rate books.
  - User-friendly interface with CSS and FXML support.

## System Requirements
- **Language:** Java 17 or higher.
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code
- **Libraries/Dependencies:** 
  - JavaFX for the user interface.
  - JUnit for testing.
  - Other dependencies are declared in `module-info.java`.

## How to Use

1. **Download the application:**
   - Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Nezuko1909/Library_Management_Application/releases) section of the GitHub repository.
   - Download the latest `.jar` file (`Library-management-system.jar`).

2. **Run the application:**
   - Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed on your system. Verify the version by running:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - Navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file and execute the following command:
     ```bash
     java -jar library-management-system.jar
     ```

3. **Interact with the application:**
   - The application will open with a graphical user interface (GUI).
   - Use its features to manage documents, users, and borrowing/return transactions.

4. **Optional: Configure runtime options (if needed):**
   - If you face issues with JavaFX, ensure the required runtime arguments are added:
     ```bash
     java --module-path <path-to-javafx> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar library-management-system.jar
     ```
     Replace `<path-to-javafx>` with the directory where JavaFX is installed on your system.

5. **Feedback and Issues:**
   - If you encounter bugs or have suggestions, report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nezuko1909/Library_Management_Application/issues) section of the repository.
